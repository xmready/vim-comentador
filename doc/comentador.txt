INTRODUCTION                                    *comentador-intro*

Comentador toggles comments using operator-pending motions, line-wise
commands, visual selections, or the command-line. Comment markers are
automatically detected from the 'commentstring' and 'comments' options.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                        *comentador-mappings*

                                                *gc*
gc{motion}              Toggle comments over {motion} or text-objects.

                        Commenting adds inline comments on each line. Uncommenting
                        removes inline, inline-block, and multi-line block comments.
                        If commenting a single blank line, the cursor is positioned
                        in insert mode. To remove multi-line block comments when
                        {motion} is a range, the beginning and end of the {motion}
                        range must be block markers. Errors on improper block usage.

                                                *gcc*
gcc                     Toggle comment on [count] lines.

                        Commenting adds inline comments to each line.
                        Uncommenting removes inline, inline-block, and
                        multi-line block comments. If commenting a single
                        blank line, the cursor is positioned in insert mode.
                        Errors on improper block usage.

                                                *gcgc* *gcu*
gcu                     Uncomment contiguous inline-commented lines.

                        Equivalent to |gcgc|. Selects all adjacent commented
                        lines and removes both inline and inline-block
                        comments. When used on an uncommented line, inserts an
                        inline comment on that line.

                                                *gb*
gb{motion}              Toggle block comments over {motion} or text-objects.

                        Commenting adds a block comment. Uncommenting removes
                        any block type comments. When commenting a single line,
                        inline-block style is used. If commenting a single blank
                        line, the cursor is positioned in insert mode. To remove
                        multi-line block comments when {motion} is a range, the
                        beginning and end of the {motion} range must be block
                        markers. Errors if block markers unavailable, or improper
                        block usage.

                                                *gbb*
gbb                     Toggle block comment on [count] lines.

                        Commenting adds a block comment on [count] lines.
                        Uncommenting removes any block type comments. When
                        commenting a single line, inline-block style is used.
                        If commenting a single blank line, the cursor is positioned
                        in insert mode. To remove multi-line block comments when
                        [count] is a range, the beginning and end of the [count]
                        range must be block markers. Errors if block markers
                        unavailable, or improper block usage.

                                                *gbu*
gbu                     Uncomment contiguous inline-block commented lines.

                        Equivalent to |gbgb|. Selects all adjacent inline-block
                        commented lines and removes the block markers. When
                        used on an uncommented line, inserts an inline-block
                        comment on that line.

                                                *v_gc*
{Visual}gc              Toggle comments on selected lines.

                        Commenting adds inline comments to each line.
                        Uncommenting removes inline-block comments, multi-line
                        block comments and inline comments. To remove multi-line
                        block comments when {Visual} is a range, the beginning
                        and end of the {Visual} range must be block markers.
                        Errors on improper block usage.

                                                *v_gb*
{Visual}gb              Toggle multi-line block comment around selection.

                        Commenting adds a block comment the selected lines.
                        Uncommenting removes inline-block comments and
                        block comments. If the selection is a single line,
                        commenting adds an inline-block style comment. To remove
                        multi-line block comments when {Visual} is a range, the
                        beginning and end of the {Visual} range must be block
                        markers. Errors if block markers unavailable or improper
                        block usage.

==============================================================================
TEXT-OBJECTS                                    *comentador-text-objects*

The gc and gb mappings work as text objects with other operators:

    dgc                 Delete contiguous commented lines               *dgc*
    cgc                 Change contiguous commented lines               *cgc*
    ygc                 Yank contiguous commented lines                 *ygc*
    dgb                 Delete contiguous inline-block commented lines  *dgb*
    cgb                 Change contiguous inline-block commented lines  *cgb*

Blank lines adjacent to comment blocks are included in the selection. When
used with d (delete) or y (yank), leading blank lines are trimmed but trailing
blank lines are preserved (outer selection). When used with c (change), blank
lines are trimmed from both ends (inner selection), leaving only the commented
content for replacement.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                        *comentador-commands*

                                                *:Comentador*
:[range]Comentador           Toggle inline comments on [range].

                             Without a range, operates on the current line.
                             With a range, operates on all lines in the range.
                             Equivalent to |gc|{motion} for the specified lines.

                                                *:ComentadorBlock*
:[range]ComentadorBlock      Toggle block comments on [range].

                             Without a range, operates on the current line.
                             With a range, operates on all lines in the range.
                             Equivalent to |gb|{motion} for the specified lines.

==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZATION                                   *comentador-customization*

                                                *comentador-plug-mappings*
Plug mappings ~

Override default mappings using <Plug> mappings:

    <Plug>(Comentador)
        gc operator (Normal, Visual, Operator-pending)

    <Plug>(ComentadorLine)
        gcc command (Normal)

    <Plug>(ComentadorBlock)
        gb operator (Normal, Visual, Operator-pending)

    <Plug>(ComentadorBlockLine)
        gbb command (Normal)

Example: >
    nmap <leader>c  <Plug>(Comentador)
    nmap <leader>cc <Plug>(ComentadorLine)
    xmap <leader>c  <Plug>(Comentador)
    omap <leader>c  <Plug>(Comentador)
<
                                                *comentador-markers* *b:comentador_markers*
Comment markers ~

Markers are parsed from 'commentstring' and 'comments' options and cached in
|b:comentador_markers|. For unsupported filetypes, set 'commentstring' for
inline comments. If block markers are missing (no s1 and ex flags in
'comments'), add them to the existing value: >

    autocmd FileType apache setlocal commentstring=#\ %s
    autocmd FileType myfile setlocal comments+=s1:/*,ex:*/
<
If no comment format is defined for a filetype, all mappings will error with
"No comment format defined for this filetype".
